# Configuring your database

Inside the web directory you'll find your config files for each environment. Update the database connection URL accordingly.

# Adding endpoints:

1. Inside the interface directory you can create a new service as you would normally.
2. Run `flair generate controllers`
3. Your controller files will now be added to the controllers directory.
